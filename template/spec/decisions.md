## 2026-10-10: Starter app

- The starter app has two screens, Home and Settings, implemented the same way on all three platforms as a reference for new features.
- The appearance setting is stored locally under `settings.appearance` as `system`, `light` or `dark`, on every platform.
- There's no backend yet. Each feature reads and writes through a repository interface with a local implementation.
- Dependencies are wired by hand in an `AppContainer` on every platform, with no DI framework.
